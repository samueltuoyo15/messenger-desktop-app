# Secure Messenger Desktop 🛡️

## Overview
Secure Messenger Desktop is a cross-platform communication client engineered for performance and privacy. Built with **TypeScript**, **Electron**, and **React**, it leverages a local **SQLite** database to ensure message persistence and high-speed data retrieval without relying on external cloud overhead for local state.

The architecture follows a strict separation of concerns, utilizing Electron's main process for heavy-duty database operations and a streamlined React frontend for a reactive user interface. By implementing **Redux Toolkit** and **Better-SQLite3**, the application handles complex data relationships and large message histories with minimal latency.

## Features
- **Local SQLite Persistence**: Uses `better-sqlite3` with optimized indexing for lightning-fast message history searches and chat retrieval.
- **Type-Safe Architecture**: End-to-end TypeScript implementation ensures data integrity between the Main and Renderer processes.
- **IPC Communication**: Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) handling for seamless interaction between the system-level backend and the UI.
- **Modern UI Stack**: Built with React 19 and Material UI for a professional, responsive, and accessible user experience.
- **Automated Update Pipeline**: Integrated with `electron-updater` for managed application lifecycle and deployment.
- **Real-time Ready**: Built-in support for WebSockets (`ws`) to facilitate instant messaging synchronization.

## Usage

### Local Database Interaction
The core of the application is the `database.service.ts`, which manages chat data locally. For recruiters looking at the data layer, the service handles indexed queries to ensure O(1) or O(log n) retrieval times on message histories.

**Seeding the Database**
To initialize the application with development data, the `seedDatabase()` function can be triggered in the main process. It populates the SQLite tables with mock data for testing high-volume message scenarios.

**Executing IPC Calls**
Communication between the UI and the system is handled through the Preload script. You can trigger system events from the React components:
```tsx
const handlePing = () => {
  window.electron.ipcRenderer.send('ping')
}
```

### Build and Deployment
The project is configured for multi-platform distribution. You can generate production-ready installers using the following scripts:
- **Windows**: `npm run build:win` (Generates `.exe` via NSIS)
- **MacOS**: `npm run build:mac` (Generates `.dmg`)
- **Linux**: `npm run build:linux` (Generates `.AppImage` and `.deb`)

## Technical Specifications

### Data Schemas

**Chat Object**
```json
{
  "id": "number (Primary Key)",
  "title": "string",
  "lastMessageAt": "number (Timestamp)",
  "unreadCount": "number"
}
```

**Message Object**
```json
{
  "id": "number (Primary Key)",
  "chatId": "number (Foreign Key)",
  "ts": "number (Timestamp)",
  "sender": "string",
  "body": "string"
}
```

### IPC Endpoints
#### [SEND] `ping`
**Purpose**: Verifies communication between the renderer and main process.
**Response**: Logs `pong` in the main process terminal.
